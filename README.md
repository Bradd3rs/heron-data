# Heron Data

This seemed fairly straight forward. The only thing I was unsure about was know what transactions to use/test responses with.

I would have liked to get onto some testing if I had time. I would usualy unit test everything and potentially PACT test also.

I added Jotai as a global state management system before I recieved the test, and ended up not needing to use it.

I used Chakra-UI as it's fast and easy to use.

I kept it simple, and to a single page. I would have liked to do a bit of extraction if I had time, for example making the list items their own components etc.

I added prettier and eslit configs to format everything nicely.
